<h2>Projects</h2>
<ol type="i"> <li> <h3> Hotel Management System </h3>
<p>Developed a role-based Hotel Management System using Java, featuring three types of users: Admin, Employee, and Customer. Customers can view room details, check pricing, and book available rooms. Admins have full control over the system â€” including managing room status (booked/available), updating prices, assigning room rent, and handling employee salaries. Employees can assist in operational tasks. The project emphasizes modular design, object-oriented programming, and real-world use cases such as room booking and payment handling.</p></li>


<li><h3> School Management System </h3>
<p>Designed and developed a C#-based School Management System with three user roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student. Teachers can assign courses, submit results, share homework, notes, and send notifications. Students can view academic results, access notes, ask for counseling, check routines, and find classroom locations. Admins have full control to update course availability, modify course fees, manage academic calendars, and broadcast notifications to both teachers and students. The system follows modular and user-centric design to ensure efficiency in academic operations.</p></li>
</li>


<li><h3> Smart HealthCare System with AI-based Symptom Checker  </h3>
<p>Designed and developed a  desktop application for smart healthcare management, featuring role-based access for Patients, Doctors, and Admins. The system includes an AI-powered symptom checker that uses a machine learning model  to provide preliminary diagnoses based on user input. Patients can book appointments, receive prescriptions, view medical history, and get automated health reminders. Doctors can manage appointments, update treatment plans, and track patient records. The application simulates real-time health data and provides printable medical reports. Emphasizes OOP, modular architecture, and efficient healthcare workflow automation.</p></li>


<li><h3> Smart AI-Chatbot  </h3>
<p> Developed an AI-powered desktop chatbot that simulates natural human conversation. The chatbot is capable of understanding user inputs and generating intelligent, context-aware responses.The application features a modern, user-friendly Windows Forms interface with conversation history, typing simulation, and real-time message exchange. Designed with modular architecture, supporting future expansion like voice input, intent detection, and multi-language support.</p></li>
